created this bot as a fun little side project to try and learn some libraries. 

Had fun with this project, however it does suck (sometimes it doesn't detect the rarity of the pokemon, and does nothing as a result)

No captcha support, no fishing support, no rebuying pokeballs.

If you do use it, make sure to watch over the bot to not get banned
